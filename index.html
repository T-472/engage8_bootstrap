                        attractions and appeal of the state of Hawaii are iconic and bear a bombastic
                        reputation to denizens the world over, but could just as easily be overwhelming for newcomers.

                <p class="">The locations to be listed on this site pertain to one of the Hawaiian islands,
                    <mark>O'ahu</mark>, which
                    notably houses Honolulu. Key locations to hit are named in the context of the visitor
                    conducting their stay at Waikiki Beach and strike a moderate balance of both simple sight-seeing
                    and working those glutes (you did achieve peak beach bod before coming here...right?)

                            <p>Located a little ways near the northern side of O'ahu Island, this is a gorgeous temple
                                located
                                within the Valley of the Temples. Due to its distance, a rented mode
                                of transportation would be highly advised and doubles as a means to access the next
                                locations.

                            <p>A sacred historical site near the western edge that triples as a laid-back trekking trail
                                and
                                biodiversity powerhouse. Witness the native flora and fauna that ends with pleasant
                                miniature
                                waterfall that visitors can also take a dip in.</p>

                            <p>An incredibly short drive from the main city center (through traffic that nearly mirrors
                                that of
                                Los Angeles), Diamond Head is an immensely popular climb to the top of the crater and
                                presents a
                                picturesque landscape view of Waikiki Beach and further beyond. The hike is testing, but
                                certainly not insurmountable, so newbies need not be intimidated. Entry requires advance
                                booking, so plan ahead!</p>

                            <p>Being a huge WWII enjoyer (particularly of the naval aspects), I just had to check out
                                one of the
                                historical sites on O'ahu Island. While perhaps not as infamous as Pearl Harbor or
                                bearing an
                                equal
                                amount of significance, it is within walking distance of Waikiki beach. The free
                                admission and
                                lack of crowds make this location a very relaxing means of immersing in history.</p>
